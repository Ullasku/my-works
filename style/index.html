            “A photograph is usually looked at seldom looked into.”  “A good photograph is knowing where to stand.”  “You don't take a photograph, you make it.” “Photography is more than a medium for factual communication of ideas.“The more pictures you see, the better you are as a photographer.” “I am not interested in shooting new things. I am interested to see things new.” “Photography to me is catching a moment which is passing, and which is true.” “Photography is the story I fail to put into words.”
